Contains programs for extracting (extract-as), quantifying
(extract-as-fpkm) and comparing (collect-fpkm) AS events from transcripts
assembled from RNA-seq data in multiple conditions (e.g., tissues).

Below is a description of each program. For an example of how to run
them as a pipeline, see and run 'sh com.example'.

A. extract-as
=============

Extracts AS events from transcripts assembled from RNA-seq data. It takes
as input a GTF transcript file, such as that created by Cufflinks, and
compares all pairs of transcripts within a gene to determine exon-intron
structure differences that are indicative of an AS event. To determine AS
events among multiple samples, the input file should be the concatenation
of the transcript files of individual samples.

ATTENTION: Because only transcripts of the same gene are being compared,
gene names may first need to be reconciled among the samples. This can be done,
for instance, by using a program such as cuffcompare to assign transcripts
to a Gold Reference, such as the Ensembl or UCSC gene sets.

The following types of events are currently implemented: exon skipping
(SKIP), cassette exons (MSKIP), alternative transcript start and
termination (TSS, TTS), retention of single or multiple introns (IR, MIR),
and alternative exon (AE). For more details on the specific conditions
please see the documents on our web site (http://genomics.jhu.edu/software/ASprofile/).

The same event may be discovered and reported multiple times, in
different transcripts. For this reason, we recommend that you run the
script summarize_as.pl to create a non-redundant listing (catalog) of
all events. This format is also required for the rest of the programs
in the ASprofile suite.


B. extract-as-fpkm
==================

Calculates the FPKM of each event from those of transcripts harboring
the event in a given sample, (optionally) allowing for a margin of error
(W) at the boundaries of the exons and introns.

Output form:
event_id        event_type      gene_id chrom   event_start     event_end       event_pattern   strand  fpkm
1000021	SKIP_ON	ENSG00000000457	chr1	169833510	169833649	169831938,169833510-169833649,169836037	-	3.7846400000

Columns 1-8 are as described above. Column 9 gives the FPKM value in the input sample.


C. collect-fpkm.pl
==================

For each AS event in the catalog, collects fpkm values for all samples,
and calculates and compares splicing ratios across samples, as described
in the paper. The results can be used to observe trends in the dynamics of
AS profiles and select promising candidates for laboratory testing, but
there is yet no rigorous statitical testing to assess  significance. We
plan to add such a component in a future release.
