This guide tells how to compile and install the software.

1) To compile, simply type:

% make all

The software is compiled in place. 

If you see any errors, please send us an email including the error message
and the program version (this is the listed in the directory name). The
software was developed for RedHat Linux and may need adjustments to work
on other Unix platforms.

2) Installation - none needed.

Software was compiled and must be run from its own directory. Alternatively,
modify the PATH variable in your .cshrc (.bash_profile, etc) file to include 
the ASprofile directory.

3) Run the program from its own directory, then manually move the files
elsewhere on the system, where desired.
