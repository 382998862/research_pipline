RN7SK	AIDS	Expression	Stable expression of cdNIPP1 increased CDK9 phosphorylation on Thr(186) and the association of CDK9 with 7SK RNA. The stable expression of cdNIPP1 disrupted the interaction of Tat and PP1 and inhibited HIV-1 transcription. Expression of cdNIPP1 as a part of the HIV-1 genome inhibited HIV-1 replication.	chr6	52995620	52995951	+	Human	7SK	NR_001445	21098020

RN7SK	AIDS	Interaction	Tat efficiently replaces HEXIM1 on the 7SK snRNA in vivo and therefore, it promotes the disassembly of the 7SK/HEXIM/P-TEFb negative transcriptional regulatory snRNP to augment the nuclear level of active P-TEFb.  The human 7SK snRNA carries a TAR RNA-like Tat-binding element that is essential for the normal transcriptional regulatory function of 7SK questions the viability of HIV therapeutic approaches based on small drugs blocking the Tat-binding site of HIV TAR.	chr6	52995620	52995951	+	Human	7SK	NR_001445	20976203

VL30 LTRs	hepatocellular carcinoma	Expression	Trim24 (Tif1) and Trim33 (Tif1) interact to form a co-repressor complex that suppresses murine hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that Trim24 and Trim33 cooperatively repress retinoic acid receptor-dependent activity of VL30-class endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in liver. In Trim24-knockout hepatocytes, VL30 derepression leads to accumulation of reverse-transcribed VL30 cDNA in the cytoplasm that correlates with activation of the viral-defense interferon responses mimicking the preneoplastic inflammatory state seen in human liver following exogenous viral infection. Furthermore, upon derepression, VL30 long terminal repeats (LTRs) act as promoter and enhancer elements deregulating expression of neighboring genes and generating enhancer RNAs that are required for LTR enhancer activity in hepatocytes in vivo.
